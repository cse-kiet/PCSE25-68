2. Tushar Kumar (2100290100176)
3. Pranav Mishra (2100290100116)

## Steps for Execution:
1. STEP 1: Data Collection: Source from EHRs, Kaggle, UCI Repository, or public datasets. Include features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.
2. STEP 2: Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, encode categorical values.
3. STEP 3: Model Selection: Train and evaluate models like SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest. Choose best model per disease using metrics (Accuracy, F1, Recall).
4. STEP 4: Train/Test Split: Use train/test split and cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
5. STEP 5: Model Training and Saving: Train the models and serialize them using pickle.
6. STEP 6: Build Streamlit UI: Accept user input and display predictions interactively.
7. STEP 7: Deployment: Deploy locally or on cloud (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku).
